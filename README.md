## Python Language Notes

This repo is my personal "notebook" of language features and observations as I skill up on python. It consists of miscellaneous language features of specific interest to me that arise while I work on various learning and projects so that I can come back to it as a reference as needed.

I've added observations to help me anchor concepts in Python to those I already use and value in Javascript so I can onboard them more quickly.

The starting notebook is [language_notes.ipynb](./language-notes.ipynb) where I keep miscellaneous notes until they accrue enough content to break out into a separate one.
